I developed a mini-calendar plugin for my client’s website.
I decided that alternative plugins from the WordPress repository were not suitable due to the specific requirements of the customer.

What is included in the plugin options:
1) output of year and month
2) display a calendar with dates
3) inputs for feedback
Peculiarities:
1) you cannot select a past date
2) you can select several dates at once
3) the calendar displays the current day-week
4) warnings if the client entered incorrect data 
5) after pressing the “send” button, the trigger for displaying additional information is triggered
It took me 25 hours to develop the mini-plugin + agree on technical information.
